# Image_Captioning_with_CNN_RNN
We will develop and train an image-to-caption model that can provide descriptions for real-world photos.This project involves an encoder that encodes the image files into the vectorised representation with the help of Convolutional Neural Network and then we use sequential architecture of Recurrent Neural Networks to generate captions for the images. 
We chose to use the pretrained Inception V3 architecture as the CNN encoder and the Long Short Term Memory as the RNN architecture.
